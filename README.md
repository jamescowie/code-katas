# Code kata's

These are the solutions and instructions for all of the different kata's I attempt. Every
kata follows TDD. This repo is a way for me to track all of the different kata's that I do but also
to share some of them with everyone. I find them from code-wars, programming-challenges and the known
code kata's websites. Each kata will have a readme describing the problem as well as my solution. _Warning my solution might not be the most optimal_ 

### Kata's 
#### ALGORITHMS
   - Sums of lots of numbers - Print the sum of all whole numbers for a given range.

#### LOGIC
   - Shortest word - Print the number of characters for the smallest word in a sentence.
